Unpack the botcheck archive.

In the install.sql file, change the "who" lines. At
this point in time you cannot add more who commands
through botmaster.

Load the SQL code into a sqlite database once you've
made changes to the install.sql file

	sqlite bot.db ".read install.sql"

Change into the main directory and add new IRC servers.
IRC servers must include a port

	./botmaster add server irc.dal.net:6667
	./botmaster add server irc.prison.net:6667
	etc...

Also add nicks to the nick pool

	./botmaster add nick mynick1
	./botmaster add nick mynick2
	etc...

One bot will be run on each IRC server. Bot names
will be reused as needed.

Start your botnet when you're done

	./botmaster start all

Logs of all the IRC traffic are kept in the logs/
directory.

To stop your botnet, issue the following command

	./botmaster stop all

All bots will die.
