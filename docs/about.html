				Why's it called botcheck?

			<td style='vertical-align: top;'>A.</td>
			<td>
				For the same reason my vsftpd log parser is called 'bananas'; I couldnt
		    		think of a better name

			<td>
				It sits on IRC servers and does /who commands all day long. It writes
				out the names of users and the channels they are in if it finds anyone
				who matches the /who commands
			</td>

				Does it generate false positives?
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td style='vertical-align: top;'>A.</td>
			<td>
				Yes if you dont specify the /who arguments correctly
			</td>

			<td style='font-weight: bold;'>Q.</td>
			<td style='font-weight: bold;'>
				Why not just use snort and let it sniff IRC traffic to alert on it?
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style='vertical-align: top;'>A.</td>
			<td>
				Because that's overkill for the job we needed done. Snort involves
				a database server, and rules that need to be configured, and you need
				to stick it on a SPAN port on your switch, or put it in some other
				location that can see all your border traffic.
				<p>
				botcheck is stupidly simple to use. You tell it who it should look for,
				you tell it the servers to look on, and you wait for it to send what it
				has found to syslog

				What are the system requirements
			</td>

			<td style='vertical-align: top;'>A.</td>

				I run it on Scientific Linux Fermi 4 (RHEL4) with Python 2.3.4.
				It should work on any Linux distro though.

				How many IRC servers can it connect to?
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td style='vertical-align: top;'>A.</td>
			<td>
				Good question. How many forked processes can your system handle?
			</td>
		</tr>

		<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

		<tr>
			<td style='font-weight: bold;'>Q.</td>
			<td style='font-weight: bold;'>
				What happens if you get bounced or disconnected or the server splits?
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style='vertical-align: top;'>A.</td>
			<td>
				The library I use tells me that it handles disconnects for me.
				It also handles PINGs for me and as far as I know, if I get
				disconnected, the library will try to reconnect me.

			<td style='font-weight: bold;'>
				What other cool things can I do with it?
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style='vertical-align: top;'>A.</td>
			<td>
				Some cool things I do with it are catch the commands that
				are sent to the bot. This makes for some interested logs
				since people try to run commands on it, have conversations
				with it, DCC files to it, or spam it :-)
				<p>
				Another cool thing that one can do, now or in the future,
				is send all that extra stuff to a sqlite database and create
				metrics with it. Metrics make people happy.
				<p>
				It supports a whitelist so you can tell it to not flag certain
				users.
				<p>
				You can (and should) specify different nicks for each server
				you connect to. None of those nicks will show up in the bots
				logs though.
