There's really nothing to install. Just run the python script,
sit back, and wait.

	python botcheck.py

I have debugging turned on so that you can see what botcheck
is doing. If you want to disable debugging, open the irclib.py
file and change DEBUG to 0 at the top of the file.

This version of botcheck does not connect to an arbitrary number
of IRC servers. Right now it can only connect to 1. The next release
will likely allow an arbitrary number of servers.

Alerts will be sent through syslog. The messages look like this

If the user was simply on the server
	BOTCHECK - The system [host] was found on [server] using the nickname [nick]

If the user was on the server and in a channel
	BOTCHECK - The system [host] was found in the channel [channel] on [server] using the nickname [nick]

If you want to change the syslog message, it's located in the
botcheck.py file.
