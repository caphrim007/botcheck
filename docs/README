botcheck is an application that reads in data from multiple
sources to provide alerting to IRC traffic (legit or not)
that is running over the network

botcheck controls an army of watching bots that will query
IRC servers for a list of users in the domains you specify

botcheck supports an arbitrary number of bots.
Bots can be added on the fly.
Bots will re-connect if killed or disconnected.

Bots cannot be controlled from IRC. There is no risk to your
security program when running this tool. You can only control
the bots from the botmaster script. Bots will only answer to
server pings that are necessary to keep them alive on the server.

Alerts will be sent through syslog. The messages look like this

If the user was simply on the server
	BOTCHECK - The system [host] was found on [server] using the nickname [nick]

If the user was on the server and in a channel
	BOTCHECK - The system [host] was found in the channel [channel] on [server] using the nickname [nick]

If you want to change the syslog message, it's located in the
botcheck.py file.
